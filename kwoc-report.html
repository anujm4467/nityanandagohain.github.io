                    This was my first PR I just updated the color of the table and updated the readme with a newly taken screenshot.
                    I also got a bit familiar with the codebase.By this time I started to read pygame documentation .

                    Initially the paddle's were rectangular in shape and size of the puck was small.
                    In this PR,I canged the paddle to a concentric circle to make it more natural and also increased the puck 
                    size.

                    We had to create a start-screen because the gameplay starts directly after launching the game.So I worked on this issue 
                    and it was a  challenging one and  till then i havent done something that advance.So it was quite an experience .
                    I created a new file named as startScreen.py and I had implemented a screen which will show up  first
                    when the game is launched.

                    While playing the game there used to be a default color of paddle which cannot be changed. So i added option to
                    choose paddle colors for both the players in the startscreen which looked quite empty previously.

                    The game can be paused in the middle but it lacked some features like reset, exit so in this PR i implemented
                    buttons in the pause-screen to reset, continue and exit. I also coloured all the three of them.

                    The game had option to choose paddle color but there was no option to choose the table background(theme) .
                    I created a new file names themeScreeb.py and added four options so that one of the user can select the theme.
                    It appers right after the start-screen.

                    So by this time <a href="https://github.com/thealphadollar">@thealphadollar</a> had implemented an end screen
                    where the winner name was flashing. So in this pr I implemented the same concept to the AirHockey logo in the
                    start-screen and made it flashing.

                    In the themeScreen.py previously i wrote seperate code for all the four options of background. So i reduced it
                    by storing the required (x/y) values in an array and used a for loop to iterate over it. Now the code was much
                    neat than the previous one.

                        In the game we had an background music so while playing the game if the music finishes the music didn't

                    Our game was lacking an ingame help which can be used by new players. So i created an ingame help which can be

                    This was the most intersting issue i have sloved. So there was no option to add player name in the game
                    so when i searched for some gui input taking method in the pygame library i couldn't find any. But with some 
                    help from <a href="https://github.com/thealphadollar">@thealphadollar</a> and my Mentor i was able to do it
                    and it was quite fun.
