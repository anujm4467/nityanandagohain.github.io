        It is an initiative taken by KOSS,IITKgp for students who are new to open source development,
        to get them involved during their winter vacations and break the ice of Open Source contributions.
        All of the work is done in <a href="https://github.com">Github</a>. 
        <br><br>
        Students can choose any project and work on it after talking to the respective project mentor. I choose AirHockey
        because I wanted to learn python (I knew the basics) and also because it was a game which got me 
        excited enough to work on this project. I mailed my mentor and he guided me after that.
    </p>

    <h2><strong>About AirHockey:-</strong></h2>
    <p>
        It is a game built in Python using the PyGame library. The game was in its initial stage of development with just 
        one screen where the gameplay started directly, but after KWoC it became very feature enriched with options to add name,
        choose paddle color and background color , background music was added and also easy and hard options for newcomers and 
        advanced players respectively were added and a lot more.

                        Initially, the game resolution was 800 by 600 but my suggestion was that it should be playable in full-screen 
                        mode but at last, it was not done because most of the code was hardcoded which will lead to writing the entire 
                        code form beginning. Instead, the resolution was changed to 1200 by 600.

                        So this issue addressed the problem that there was no option to mute     the music in the game which

                    Initially, the paddle's were rectangular in shape and size of the puck was small.

                    We had to create a start-screen because the game play starts directly after launching the game. So I worked on this issue 
                    and it was a  challenging one and  till then i haven't done something that advance. So it was quite an experience .
                    I created a new file named as "startScreen.py" and I had implemented a screen which will show up  first
                    when the game is launched.

                    While playing the game when a round is completed it wasn't notified to the player it was changed directly so this 
                    PR solved that issue and whenever a round is changed it is notified to the players.

                    The game had an option to mute the music but after pressing mute the background music stop's playing but in the 
                    game the sound of hitting the puck and scoring a goal was still playing so this PR fixed that bug in the game.

                    This was the most interesting issue I have solved. So there was no option to add player name to the game
                    so when I searched for some GUI input taking method in the PyGame library I couldn't find any. But with some 
                    help from <a href="https://github.com/thealphadollar">@thealphadollar</a> and my Mentor i was able to do it
                    and it was quite fun.

    <h2><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
    <p>
        So overall KWoC'17 was a great experience I learned a lot and got to know people with similar interest. I was a beginner
        in python and I didn't know how to use the PyGame library but after this program, my python skills have improved drastically 
        and I also learned to use the PyGame library, all of this in a very short span of time. Previously I had the fear of putting 
        up pull requests or I used to get scared by the huge code base. I used to think how could I contribute because I couldn't 
        understand anything about how that much code works together. But after this event all that was gone. I started to love programming more.<br><br>

        Finally,<br>
        I thank my mentor <a href="https://github.com/Aniq55">@Aniq55</a> who was very supportive through the entire event.
        And the KWoC team, you all are great, thank you for organizing such a great event.
